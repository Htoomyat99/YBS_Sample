## Android Development with EAS Build

If you are using custom native modules or need a development build:

1. **Build the development APK:**
   ```bash
   eas build -p android --profile preview
   ```
2. **Install the APK on your Android device.**
3. **Start the Metro bundler:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
4. **Open the app on your device.**  
   The app will connect to your local dev server for live development.

> **Note:** This is required if you use native modules not supported by Expo Go.
